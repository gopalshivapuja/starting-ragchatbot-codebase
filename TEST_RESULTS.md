- ✅ Returns formatted results (4123 characters)
- ✅ Includes proper context headers

### 3. End-to-End API Test (PASSED ✅)

**Query**: "What is covered in lesson 5 of the MCP course?"

**Result**:
- ✅ Response generated successfully (2110 characters)
- ✅ Comprehensive answer about MCP client creation
- ✅ 5 sources returned with proper links
- ✅ Session ID created correctly

## Key Findings

### What's Working Correctly

1. **Vector Store**
   - ChromaDB properly loaded with 4 courses
   - Semantic search functioning correctly
   - Course resolution working (fuzzy matching)
   - Metadata retrieval operational

2. **Search Tools**
   - CourseSearchTool correctly queries vector store
   - CourseOutlineTool retrieves course structures
   - Source tracking working properly
   - Tool definitions properly formatted for Anthropic API

3. **AI Generator**
   - Successfully calls tools when needed
   - Properly formats tool parameters
   - Handles tool results correctly
   - Conversation history integration working

4. **RAG System**
   - End-to-end query flow operational
   - Session management functioning
   - Source attribution working
   - Both content and outline queries supported

### Potential Issues (Not Reproduced)

The reported "query failed" issue **could not be reproduced** in testing. Possible causes:

1. **Temporary API Issue**: Anthropic API may have been temporarily unavailable
2. **API Key Issue**: API key might have been invalid or missing at that time
3. **Database State**: Vector store might have been empty during the error
4. **Browser Cache**: Frontend might have been showing cached error state
5. **Network Issue**: Connection problem between client and server

### Recommendations

Since all tests pass and the system is functioning correctly:

1. **Monitor for Recurrence**: If "query failed" appears again, check:
   - Server logs for actual error message
   - Browser console for frontend errors
   - Network tab for failed requests
   - Anthropic API status

2. **Add Error Logging**: Enhance error messages to be more specific:
   - Log actual exception messages
   - Include stack traces in development mode
   - Add API key validation on startup

3. **Frontend Error Handling**: Improve user-facing error messages:
   - Distinguish between different error types
   - Provide actionable guidance
   - Show retry options

## Test Commands

To run tests yourself:

```bash
# Run all unit tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Run integration tests
uv run pytest tests/test_integration.py -v -s

# Run specific test class
uv run pytest tests/test_search_tools.py::TestCourseSearchTool -v

# Test with coverage
uv run pytest tests/ --cov=backend --cov-report=html
```

## Conclusion

**The RAG system is functioning correctly.** All components are operational:
- ✅ Vector store searches working
- ✅ Tools executing properly
- ✅ AI generation with tool calling functional
- ✅ End-to-end queries successful
- ✅ Source attribution working

If "query failed" errors occur in the future, they are likely due to:
- Temporary API/network issues
- Configuration problems (API key, etc.)
- Frontend caching issues

The comprehensive test suite (34 tests total) is now in place to quickly identify any component failures.
