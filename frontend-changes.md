## Technical Implementation

### Theme Switching Mechanism
```javascript
// Theme is stored as data-theme attribute on body
document.body.setAttribute('data-theme', 'light');
// CSS uses attribute selector to apply light theme
[data-theme="light"] { /* light theme variables */ }
```

### Icon Visibility Logic
- Dark theme: Shows moon icon (click to go light)
- Light theme: Shows sun icon (click to go dark)
- Controlled via CSS display properties based on `data-theme` attribute

### Accessibility
- Proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast maintained in both themes
- Focus indicators visible in both themes

## User Experience
- Theme preference persists across sessions
